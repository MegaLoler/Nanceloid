# Negative Nancy's Waveguide Network Playground

a waveguide network engine with a planned vst frontend!

VERY wip lol

## How to build

just type `make` and it'll build the library and a test program in the `build` directory (which it will create)

`make run` will run the test if u want

## Files

`include/nnwnp.h` is the C header for using the library

`build/libnnwnp.a` is the library itself

## Library documentation

check `include/nnwnp.h` for docs ;o
